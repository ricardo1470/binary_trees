## Description
---
In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root. Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well

## Requirements
---
simple_shell is designed to run in the `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` linux environment and to be compiled using the GNU compiler collection v. `gcc 4.8.4` with flags`-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.`

## Installation
---
Clone this repository: `"https://github.com/ricardo1470/binary_trees"`
   * Change directories into the repository: `binary_trees`
   * Compile: see installation instructions later

## Compilation
---
* Compile: In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c`.
`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c X-main.c binary_tree_file.c -o 0-node`
* Our main files will include your main header file (`binary_trees.h`): `#include binary_trees.h`

## Example of usage
---
* function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
```c
./6-pre
       .-------(098)-------.
  .--(012)--.         .--(402)--.
(006)     (056)     (256)     (512)
98
12
6
56
402
256
512
```

*  function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
```c
./10-depth
  .-------(098)--.
(012)--.       (128)--.
     (054)          (402)
Depth of 98: 0
Depth of 128: 1
Depth of 54: 2
```

* function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
```c
./16-perfect
       .-------(098)-------.
  .--(012)--.         .--(128)--.
(010)     (054)     (010)     (402)
Perfect: 1

       .-------(098)-------.
  .--(012)--.         .--(128)-------.
(010)     (054)     (010)       .--(402)
                              (010)
Perfect: 0

       .-------(098)-------.
  .--(012)--.         .--(128)-------.
(010)     (054)     (010)       .--(402)--.
                              (010)     (010)
Perfect: 0
```
